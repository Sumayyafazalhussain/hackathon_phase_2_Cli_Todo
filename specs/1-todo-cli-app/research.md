# Research Findings: Todo CLI App

**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Spec**: specs/1-todo-cli-app/spec.md
**Plan**: specs/1-todo-cli-app/plan.md

## Clarification Research

Based on the detailed feature specification (`specs/1-todo-cli-app/spec.md`) and the defined project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`), all technical context points were sufficiently clear or had reasonable defaults that could be assumed. No specific "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers were present in the feature specification, and the implementation plan outlines the choices made regarding language, dependencies, storage, and platform.

Therefore, no additional research was required to resolve ambiguities or clarify requirements at this stage.
